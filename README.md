# Final_Year_Project_On-Time-Bus
On-Time Bus is a smart bus scheduling system that allows users to view, track and route their journey on given bus service. This system would also enable the business owners/managers to manage their running buses/ routes/ drivers. They could also track the buses running on a particular route. The system utilizes the modern multi-Platform app development tool, React-Native. It also utilizes APIs from Google Maps. The On-Time-Bus system acts as an intermediary between the end-user (passenger) and the service provider (Business owner/Manager) and fills the gaps in communication using the latest technology, which is not necessarily human-to-human communication. This system also takes 3 out of the “guesswork” and ambiguity involved in the automobile industry, for example guessing how long it would take for a bus to arrive at a particular stop and pay for its ride through RFID and for the admin panel, an admin always sees users’ data, add routes, add buses using the web.
